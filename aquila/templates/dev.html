  <h1>Development</h1>
  <h2>Current goals</h2>
  <p>Things to do:</p>
  <ul class="enum">
    <li>bring all of Aquila 2.5 features to version 3</li>
    <li>increase overall <strong>test coverage</strong> for existing features</li>
    <li>provide <strong>binaries</strong> for common platforms (Windows installers, .deb packages etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Compatibility</h2>
  <p>Aquila uses a few features from the <strong>C++11</strong> standard (integer types, smart pointers, lambda functions etc.), therefore a modern compiler is required to succesfully build the library. This includes gcc &gt;= 4.6, MS Visual Studio &gt;= 2010 or clang &gt;= 3.1.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=aquila">CDash dashboard</a> can be used to assess compatibility as it collects test results from various builds. </p>

  <h2>Testing</h2>
  <p>If you want to run unit tests to check that the library works as it should, run two commands:</p>
  <div class="highlight"><pre><code>make aquila_test
ctest</code></pre></div>
  <p>The first one only builds the test suite, while the second command runs it using CTest.</p>
  <p>A continous integration service is provided by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/zsiciarz/aquila">Travis CI dashboard!</a>. Tests are run after each and every push to master branch at GitHub, using both GCC and clang.</p>

  <h2>Contributing</h2>
  <p>Aquila source code is hosted at <a href="http://github.com/zsiciarz/aquila">GitHub</a>. GitHub makes contributing ridiculously simple - just fork the project, work on it in your repository and when you're done, send me a pull request.</p>

  <h2>Issue tracking</h2>
  <p>Again, Aquila relies on GitHub for issue tracking. If you're a registered GitHub user and you'd like to share your ideas or report bugs, feel free to <a href="http://github.com/zsiciarz/aquila/issues">file an issue</a>.</p>
